## Implications of the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence on Developing Countries

### Abstract
The field of Artificial Intelligence has seen unprecedented growth in the last few decades up to the point where it is influencing many areas of our everyday lives such as shopping, finace and education. However, the level of exposure and usage of Artificial Intelligence tools differ greatly between endowed countries (first world) and less endowed countries (third world). Many third world countries are trailing far behind when it comes to the use of Artificial Intellegence technologies and as Artificial Intelligence is considered the future of humanity, this raises a lot of questions: why is does this disproportionate levels of exposure exist in the first place if these technologies are supposed to be openly accessible to all?, what are the current implications of this lack of exposure to the lives of people living in these countries?, and How can Artificial Intelligence technologies be made more accessible. This paper will evaluate these questions and provide insights to the way forward.

### Evidence for the disproportionate use of AI
UN estimates that nearly half of the worlds population is excluded form the benefits of digitalization tools such as AI

The IMF predicted that the disproportionate exposure to AI technologies could further widen the gap between rich and poor countries
