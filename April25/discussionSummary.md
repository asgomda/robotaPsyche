## Discussion Summary

The discussion we led (Adina and I) was on Ray Kurzweil’s 2005 book, The Singularity is Near. Ray in the first few paragraphs defined the singularity as the period during which the pace of technological progress would be so rapid and impactful that human life will be irreversibly transformed, and someone who has considered the implications of the singularity on their lives as a singularitarian. He then went on to talk about the fascinating post-singularity world where there would be no distinction between humans and machines or between the physical and virtual realities. This led to some interesting discussion on the inevitability of these implications on our own lives. The next part of the discussion was on the period of exponential growth talked about in the book. Basically, Kurzweil says that we generally underestimate what can be achieved in the long term, but over-estimate what can be achieved in the short term. Hence, artificially super-intelligent machines capable of developing their next generations without human interference will be with us sooner than expected. Ray Kurzweil then made some really accurate predictions of machine intelligence which would be achieved by the end of the 2020s. Finally, Adina’s part of the discussion centered around the more ethical parts of the reading such as poverty, unfairness, religion, life and inequality and how those would project into the world post-singularity.
