## Concept
I am planning on basing the project around the Game of Life which some modifications. The Game of life has the following rules: 

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be simpplified into the following:

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### 1. DNA
I am planning on having three different types of creatures have different features. The characteristics I am considering are speed, reproducibility threshold, size and aggression. Essentially, the three different creatures would be divided into three groups based on the above characteristics.

### 2. Natural Selection
At random intervals, the creatures would develop mutations, in their characteristics and only those who meet some characteristics would be evolve to the next generation.
