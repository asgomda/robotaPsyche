## Concept
I based the ecosystem on the three main features of an ecosystem which are feeding, reproduction, and death. In the ecosystem, there are three movers that the ecosystem is based around. 

<!-- - The first is the green mover which is the largest mover in the ecosystem. Due to its size, it is the most aggresive towards food. The level of aggression is inversely related to the amount of food present. Meaning, the the smaller the amount of food remaining at that time, the more aggresive the movers will be. 
- The second mover is the purple mover which is the second largest mover in the ecosystem 

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be simpplified into the following:

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### 1. DNA
I am planning on having three different types of creatures have different features. The characteristics I am considering are speed, reproducibility threshold, size and aggression. Essentially, the three different creatures would be divided into three groups based on the above characteristics.

### 2. Natural Selection
At random intervals, the creatures would develop mutations, in their characteristics and only those who meet some characteristics would be evolve to the next generation. -->
